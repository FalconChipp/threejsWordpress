# threejsWordpress Spec 

Aim is to create a plugin that will automatically add three.js libaries where users can easily create 3d scenes through a backend UI. 
This will include the following features; 

- Import models from Media Libary 
- To specify what loader will be needed (3mf, GLTF, OBJ, STL) with the potential to also include a GCode Loader
- For the user to add and edit lighting options through a dropdown menu and define the positions of the lights (Ambient, Spot, Directional, Point). Also to include the ability to add more than one light into a single scene

Once the scene has been created, the aim is to add the scene to the page via a shortcode.
